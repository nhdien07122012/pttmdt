== Description ==

= Why live chat? =
Chat is the easiest contact channel â€“ for you and your customers.

For you, chat is easy because one service rep can easily chat with multiple people simultaneously. Unlike phone, chat does not absorb all your focus, and you can use canned messages to answer frequent questions at lightning speed.

For your customers, chat is easy because they can continue their website experience while getting in touch. The chat box stays with them as they navigate your site. Chats tend to be short and easy, making it the channel with the lowest barrier to contact. Especially for people below 30 years, chat is the preferred mode of communication.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens when Iâ€™m not online? =
When you're not online, you can decide between a set of behaviors for Userlike's WordPress live chat plugin. One is to switch your chat to a contact form at which web visitors can leave their question and email address. You can also make the chat plugin disappear completely, or you can activate our chatbot Chat Butler to welcome your web visitors.

= Do I need a credit card to sign up? =
No, you don't need to enter any billing info to start your trial. We only ask for your billing info when you decide to upgrade to one of our paid products. You can pay with credit card, or bank transfer / PayPal for yearly subscriptions.

= What will happen after the trial? =
During the trial you will be using our premium Team package. After the trial, your account is automatically switched to our free product. So no charges or hidden fees. With Userlike Free you can have unlimited chats with your customers. You can always upgrade your account to a premium chat experience during or after the trial.

= Do you offer chatbots? =
We offer a native chatbot, Chat Butler. When you're not online, you can set up Chat Butler to welcome your web visitors, to ask them for their question, and to simultaneously notify you or your colleagues to come online. We also offer a chatbot framework through which you can connect your own chatbots.

= Can I use Userlike on my mobile phone? =
You can, but we donâ€™t offer a mobile app and we strongly recommend you to offer chat support on a computer only. Firstly, it is easy to miss notifications of incoming chats on your phone. Secondly, mobile connections are often not stable enough to support a proper chat connection. Both result in frustrated customers.

= Can I use Userlike on my mobile phone? =
Yes you can. We offer various integrations with helpdesk, CRM, and other business tools.
